>Abstract: As the distributed ledger technology industry grows, there is an increasing
demand for fast, open, and secure blockchains that can support
a diverse array of protocols. However, current impediments
such as long finality time, low scalability, and low throughput have
become great inhibitors. Furthermore, Bitcoin in its present state is
simply too volatile to be used as a secure financial asset; an alternate
solution is required. By building an Ampleforth implementation
on the Internet Computer, we provide a price-stable digital asset on
another blockchain platform that is not Ethereum. In doing so we
increase the protocol’s degree of interoperability whilst also creating
a way to measure scalability, security, and decentralization on the
Internet Computer. In this report, we present our prototype implementation
and the tests we conducted upon both Ethereum’s Ganache
network and the Internet Computer’s Sodium network. Our main
findings demonstrated that on these local networks the Ampleforth
implementation on Ganache executed faster than our Internet Computer
prototype. However, our findings also suggested that the Ampleforth
implementation is highly unlikely to scale as efficiently (on
Ethereum) compared to a deployed version of our prototype on the
Internet Computer.
